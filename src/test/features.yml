faq:
  - For what does DY stand for?
  - DreamYaml.
  -
  - What is a DYModule?
  - It is the in-memory representation of a yaml section (for example 'faq' with its key 'faq' and its values as a list, is one module).
  -
  - What is a DreamYaml object?
  - It is the in-memory representation of the full yaml file and contains all of the modules, which can be accessed by their keys.
  -
  - What is a DYReader?
  - It is responsible for reading the yaml file and parsing its objects into modules, which then get added to the DreamYaml object.
